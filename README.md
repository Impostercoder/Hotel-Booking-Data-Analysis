# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis

In this dummy project I imported a dataset from excel to SQL to power bi for analyzing and visualizing the hotel booking data to answer following stakeholder questions:

1) Is the Hotel Revenue growing by year?
- We have 2 hotel types i.e. City Hotels and Resort Hotels. So, we segmented the revenue by hotel types.

2) Should we increase parking lot size?
- We try to understand if there is a trend in guests with personal cars.

3) What trends can we see in the data?
- We focus on average daily rates and guests to explore seasonality.
